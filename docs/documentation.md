## Quick Start 

To get started, [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meka/files/) 
MEKA and run `./run.sh` (`run.bat` on Windows) to launch the GUI.

## MEKA Tutorial

The [MEKA tutorial (pdf)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/meka/files/meka-1.9.1/Tutorial.pdf) 
has numerous examples on how to run and extend MEKA.

Note also the manuscript [MEKA: A Multi-label/Multi-target Extension to WEKA](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/12-164/12-164.pdf) introducing the MEKA farmework.

See a [list of the most common methods available in MEKA](methods.md), and (command-line) examples on how to use them. More method-specific details can be found in the links below.

There are also some [examples](https://github.com/Waikato/meka/tree/master/src/main/java/mekaexamples) on how to use Meka in your own Java code.

<!-- The [API reference](http://meka.sourceforge.net/api-1.9/index.html) is available. -->



## Multi-label References and Links

MEKA originated from implementations of work from various [publications](http://jmread.github.io/publications.html) 
(note also the references therein). There are some [tutorials/slides](http://jmread.github.io/talks.html) 
about multi-label and multi-target classification in general.

Note other software that uses MEKA:

* [ADAMS](https://adams.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) framework - integrates MEKA into workflows
* [MOA environment for data streams](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~abifet/MOA/) 
  can use Updateable MEKA classifiers
* [scikit-multilearn](http://scikit-multilearn.github.io/) can interface to MEKA in Python
* [KNIME](http://www.informatik.uni-konstanz.de/ag-sapozhnikova/software/) 
  framework, includes a plugin to integrate Meka Classifiers into workflows
* [DKPro Text Classification Framework](https://code.google.com/p/dkpro-tc/)
* [scikit-multiflow](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/) uses multi-label classifiers in Python

and other multi-label links:

* [Scikit MultiFlow](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/)
* [MULAN Framework for Multi-label Classification](http://mulan.sourceforge.net/)
* [Mulan Multi-label Group](http://mlkd.csd.auth.gr/multilabel.html) from the 
  Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery Group in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.


## Getting Help 

Have a specific problem or query? Then create an issue on our Github project 
page (but please search beforehand whether not someone already asked the same question):

[github.com/Waikato/meka/issues](https://github.com/Waikato/meka/issues ) 

**NB:** Avoid contacting developers directly for MEKA-related help.


## Bugs

A list of current issues in Meka (known bugs, planned improvements, feature wishlist) 
can be found at [github.com/Waikato/meka/issues](https://github.com/Waikato/meka/issues). 
Please add one if you believe you have another (but please check first to make sure it hasn't been raised already!)


## Participating

The Meka developers never have enough time to implement everything that should 
be in Meka. If you would like to contribute something new to Meka (add a feature, 
improve some existing code), or help with any of the existing issues, please get 
in touch with the developers.
